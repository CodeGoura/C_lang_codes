## Introduction

This repository is designed to help programmers understand the fundamentals of C programming. Each C program is crafted to solve specific problems like checking for palindromes or reversing strings, and more will be added to expand the repository. Feel free to explore, contribute, and use the code in your own projects.

## Features

- Beginner-friendly C programs.
- Well-documented and modular code.
- Programs demonstrating different C concepts like loops, arrays, strings, and functions.
- Continuous updates with more C programs added regularly.

## Programs Included

1. **Palindrome Checker**  
   Checks if a string or number is a palindrome.

2. **String Reversal**  
   Reverses the input string and displays the result.

3. **[Add more programs here as you develop them]**

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder containing the C programs:

   ```bash
   cd C_lang_codes
   ```

3. Compile the C program you want to run using a C compiler like `gcc`:

   ```bash
   gcc program-name.c -o program-name
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./program-name
   ```

## Future Updates

- Additional programs demonstrating various data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues).
- More algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching).
- File handling, dynamic memory allocation, and more.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request. Contributions that add more C programs or improve existing ones are always welcome.

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b new-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add a new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin new-feature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
